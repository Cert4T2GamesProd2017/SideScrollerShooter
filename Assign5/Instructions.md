Assignment 5 : Design Interactive Media

Task - design a unique HUD element that could be used in a game prototype made in Unreal 4. Unreal supports mouse, keyboard, gamepad, touch, and for VR devices. 

Answer the following questions: 

1.	For the given game project you are working on this term, what human-computer interaction device(s) will you employ for your prototype, and why? 
2.	What is unique about the game you are designing that necessitates your specified HCI device(s)?
3.	What parameters do you feel need to be on the HUD? 

Analyse 5 common game play parameters employed in HUD for side scrolling games, such as health and inventory, and provide screenshot examples of how these elements are used in 3 different games. 
Then, compare "health" GUI elements from 5 different side scrolling games, and provide a commentary on which are the best, and explain why you think so. 
Your commentary should discuss things like: screen position, element size, clarity of data, and rate the element out of 10.
 
Design and create a mockup of the HUD element using Photoshop or create in UE4.   
Submit to GitHub:

1.  the analysis in a word document
2.  the HUD element design as images or the UE4 uasset files
